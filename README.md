# Charter/Spectrum FE Code Challenge

This project was started on October 23 at 5:00 PM MST and ended October 26th 8:00 AM

Main objectice was to fetch data with an API key and deisplay the data in a table and allow the user to sort and filter the data as needed

# Challenges & Future Iterations

The main challenges for me was getting the search and filter queries as specified in the requirements and learning how to create something that is paginated.

In the future I would like to complete the testing for each component and include some integration tests as well. I also would then apply CI/CD. I will add sorting buttons for name and states. Also allow a click on a restaurant table row to pop out some more information in an info bubble. If given more time all of this is achieveable. The only stretch goal that I have not yet attempted in my programming career has been TypeScript. I would like to achive this in the near future

# Getting Started with Create React App
